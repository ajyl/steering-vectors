One bit that is particularly subtle to me at the moment is how a differential operator is to be understood when it is supposed to act on vector - valued, or matrix - valued functions. \n\nFor example, suppose we are given a general linear partial differential operator\n\\begin{equation}\nD = \\sum\\_{|\\alpha| \\leq m} a\\_\\alpha(x)\\partial^\\alpha\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\alpha = (\\alpha\\_1, \\dots \\alpha\\_n)$ denotes a multi-index, $m$ is some positive integer, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\partial^\\alpha := \\partial^{|\\alpha|}/(\\partial^{\\alpha\\_1} x\\_1 \\dots \\partial^{\\alpha\\_n} x\\_n)$ denotes a mixed partial derivative, and the functions $a\\_\\alpha$ are smooth. In various contexts they might be vector- or matrix valued. This is already where I am having difficulties, because usually it is assumed the reader knows how to apply these operators, and from this I guess one could deduce what kind of functions these $a\\_\\alpha$ are ..\n\nHow is such an operator supposed to act on vector - valued or matrix valued functions $f : \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ or $F: GL(n,\\mathbb{R}) \\to GL(k,\\mathbb{R})$ ?\n\nUnfortunately my Calculus classes didn't cover much beyond the one - variable setting so I am shaky on these grounds.

For the past year, we recently have changed our technical stack (frameworks, etc) for our new client to something very VERY different while still somewhat supporting the old client.\n\nBecause our tech lead has not touched any of the new code, he hasn't actually taken any coding work for the new technical stack and has strictly been helping creating tickets of work of what should happen, going to meetings, and rarely helping with the old client. This has worked for a bit especially when we first started building the application and the tasks being asked were very straightforward.\n\nHowever, as our new application grows, the feature tickets start getting more complex and a lot of the engineers are unsure how to go about implementing the work. In places where I have previously worked, the technical lead would help guide the team or give perspective on how to go about implementing the feature but because at least for this team, our technical lead strictly does more clarification of what is expected of the feature and depends on the team to talk through how they might go about implementing it and if no one knows, he creates a ticket for us to figure it out.\n\nI had a 1-on-1 with him and brought up how he doesn't code as much more and his response was he was working on it but I haven't seen much change these past few weeks. I also mentioned if he has questions on transitioning he could ask the team and he said he would consider it.\n\nBecause I haven't seen much change despite that conversation, I was thinking of bringing it up with my manager but was wondering if that was actually what I should do? Or perhaps I should be more direct with my team lead? In truth, I am not fully aware of what other responsibilities he may have or if it is even my place to question my team lead. I have looked at a lot of other questions and it does sound like the [technical lead should have a strong understanding of how the application works](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/a/71297/37216) but not sure if they are actually relevant if my tech lead has been given a more managerial role.\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all the responses regarding \"not my job to babysit the lead\" -- I understand that this probably comes or can very well come off that way even though that isn't my intention. My intention was more so to voice that \"I don't feel I can ask my tech lead for advice\" which is one of the responsibilities of a tech lead and I don't really see how else that can be brought up without talking to him and/or my manager eventually.

It seems to come down to a particular line in county code law: Code requires a special-use exception for \u201cprivate garages for more than four automobiles and with floor area of more than 900 square feet in a residential district.\"\n\nThere's two conditions: 1) more than four cars, and 2) larger than 900 square feet. One side believes the word 'and' to mean it has to fulfill both conditions, whereas the other believes the exception is intended to apply to both conditions separately.\n\nMy understanding is that in the English language, the use of **and** in this sentence structure means it's referring to both things in the totality of the condition. *But*, in this case, it is also talking about two different ways of measuring the space, namely by occupancy and size. I believe it would be a little tight but four cars within 900 square feet seems reasonable for the most part.\n\nIs this a common problem in law? The use of the word **and**? Is this particular line of county code law open and shut as far as most lawyers see it?\n\n**EDIT**  \n\nBased on the answers that agree that the verbiage in this case is clear, if one is being taken to court because someone is interpreting the clause differently, why is a lawyer really required? If you have the law on your side, why isn't it as simple as stating that?

        "prompts": "[Instruction] I am making a video game on-board an old, creaky, leaky space station, which is forgotten or mostly not cared about, drifting around some moon/planet, with a single lonely, weary astronaut on board. I want it isolated and introverted, thoughtful and wistful. A bit like the movies Moon, Silent Running, or 2001 (although not forgotten about, its protagonist is isolated and lonely). \n\nThe technology level of the space station is highly realistic, and quite primitive, maybe a bit like Mir. An onboard garden would be ok. Clunky switches and knobs are preferred over holographic displays or touchscreens. \n\nMy question to Worldbuilding community is **HOW and WHY** the station and astronaut came to be in this situation... what events transpired to put him there (and then passed him by, leaving him mostly obsolete?). A core issue I have regards financial realism: How can I justify the expenses and mission importance of placing a manned station somewhere, only to let it fall into obscurity?\n\nThe best answers will support the intended atmosphere, and invoke feelings of distance, isolation, and especially the fact that the rest of the world has just moved on, leaving this poor astronaut obsolete. Good answers will not make the astronaut special in any way, he will not be the star in a tragic mission-gone-wrong, nor will he be the victim of unusual circumstance. He's just an ordinary joe stuck with a job no one else wants to do, and pretty much abandoned due to lack of interest in his situation. My core problem is that real space stations are expensive, and require regular resupplies, and so are not very likely to be forgotten or abandoned.. Good answers will explain a way around this economic difficulty.\n\nGood answers probably don't involve him or the ship being very important in the past. Sure, there would have been good reasons for him being deployed in the first place, but good answers explain how and why these reasons faded and became uninteresting. Not broken, not lost, just *uninteresting*.\n\nGood answers don't involve him pining for home, don't draw attention to home and invoke complicated thinking about home. The astronaut is not trying to escape his fate, he is just doing his daily routine, performing maintenance, but he has accepted his hopeless fate, still performs his role out of a sense of duty, and that's it. Good answers don't invite much speculation into the outside world, and in fact the more boring the answer the better. Plausible shifts of corporate or political interest would be very suitable sources of reasons, as is having the job he was initially sent to do become meaningless, but they keep him there anyway, 'just in case'.\n\nThe astronaut isn't about to die. The station can keep him alive as long as he works on its maintenance, which he does. Good answers place the astronaut in a timeless, unchanging existence.\n\nAn occasional message from mission control, and regular automated supply drops are permitted. It is ok with alternative timelines, earths and histories, etc, but the technology in use should be clunky and old, but reasonably realistic. Higher levels of technology are acceptable elsewhere in the solar sytem, as long as its nowhere near the astronaut, and could even be used to show how everyone else has moved on, leaving the astronaut behind at his post. \n\nBonus points if the station is located somewhere with a beautiful view (like Saturns rings).

One of Company A's suppliers (Company B) employed me for about 5 years but suddenly laid me off around the beginning of this year; my position was eliminated due to a top-level corporate decision.\n\nBased on what I learned about their business in the time that I was there, I know that Company B has some very serious problems with their design processes, how they handle quality issues, and their ability to meet quantity and timing commitments for manufacturing, among other things. To be blunt, I would be very surprised if Company B still exists in 5 years.\n\nPart of my new role at Company A is providing input on which suppliers' parts we use when designing new products. My new colleagues at Company A are not aware of the problems Company B is having.\n\nKnowing what I do, I don't think Company A should be using Company B's parts in any new products we design. Failing that, I think we should at least scale back on using Company B's parts. If we don't, I believe it could cost Company A a lot of money in scrap costs and lost business.\n\nAs an employee of Company A, I'm obligated to look out for the best interests of Company A. Given the responsibilities of my position, I feel this means I should speak up about the risks involved with designing new products that have Company B's parts in them.
