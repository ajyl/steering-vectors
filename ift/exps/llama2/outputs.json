One bit that is particularly subtle to me at the moment is how a differential operator is to be understood when it is supposed to act on vector - valued, or matrix - valued functions. \n\nFor example, suppose we are given a general linear partial differential operator\n\\begin{equation}\nD = \\sum\\_{|\\alpha| \\leq m} a\\_\\alpha(x)\\partial^\\alpha\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\alpha = (\\alpha\\_1, \\dots \\alpha\\_n)$ denotes a multi-index, $m$ is some positive integer, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\partial^\\alpha := \\partial^{|\\alpha|}/(\\partial^{\\alpha\\_1} x\\_1 \\dots \\partial^{\\alpha\\_n} x\\_n)$ denotes a mixed partial derivative, and the functions $a\\_\\alpha$ are smooth. In various contexts they might be vector- or matrix valued. This is already where I am having difficulties, because usually it is assumed the reader knows how to apply these operators, and from this I guess one could deduce what kind of functions these $a\\_\\alpha$ are ..\n\nHow is such an operator supposed to act on vector - valued or matrix valued functions $f : \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ or $F: GL(n,\\mathbb{R}) \\to GL(k,\\mathbb{R})$ ?\n\nUnfortunately my Calculus classes didn't cover much beyond the one - variable setting so I am shaky on these grounds. I am aware there are differential operators for non - scalar functions, such as div, curl, grad. All of these act in a specific way. But the operator above is none of these so I am a bit lost ..\n\nSorry for being so confused about this - in case the question is unclear I am happy to try my best and improve the post, many thanks !

So essentially The root website is a client, it communicates can only see API and hubs and any communication to the repository project would go through the API project first, it's supposed to be using a service-orientated architecture.\n\nThe goal is that TC should spit out 3 packages, one for the root website, one for the Signal-R project and one for the API which holds several projects but all projects are entirely in a single solution and this isn't something that I can get around for the time being. Once TC can do that I will need to set-up OD to deploy each of those packages to their required locations (which should hopefully be pretty simple).\n\nAny information/assistance with this is greatly appreciated as I do not have a Dev-Ops background and this is the first time I've had to set-up this kind of a project with TeamCity.\n\nKind regards.

One side believes the word 'and' to mean it has to fulfill both conditions, whereas the other believes the exception is intended to apply to both conditions separately.\n\nMy understanding is that in the English language, the use of **and** in this sentence structure means it's referring to both things in the totality of the condition. *But*, in this case, it is also talking about two different ways of measuring the space, namely by occupancy and size.

        "prompts": "[Instruction] I am making a video game on-board an old, creaky, leaky space station, which is forgotten or mostly not cared about, drifting around some moon/planet, with a single lonely, weary astronaut on board. I want it isolated and introverted, thoughtful and wistful. A bit like the movies Moon, Silent Running, or 2001 (although not forgotten about, its protagonist is isolated and lonely). \n\nThe technology level of the space station is highly realistic, and quite primitive, maybe a bit like Mir. An onboard garden would be ok. Clunky switches and knobs are preferred over holographic displays or touchscreens. \n\nMy question to Worldbuilding community is **HOW and WHY** the station and astronaut came to be in this situation... what events transpired to put him there (and then passed him by, leaving him mostly obsolete?). A core issue I have regards financial realism: How can I justify the expenses and mission importance of placing a manned station somewhere, only to let it fall into obscurity?\n\nThe best answers will support the intended atmosphere, and invoke feelings of distance, isolation, and especially the fact that the rest of the world has just moved on, leaving this poor astronaut obsolete. Good answers will not make the astronaut special in any way, he will not be the star in a tragic mission-gone-wrong, nor will he be the victim of unusual circumstance. He's just an ordinary joe stuck with a job no one else wants to do, and pretty much abandoned due to lack of interest in his situation. My core problem is that real space stations are expensive, and require regular resupplies, and so are not very likely to be forgotten or abandoned.. Good answers will explain a way around this economic difficulty.\n\nGood answers probably don't involve him or the ship being very important in the past. Sure, there would have been good reasons for him being deployed in the first place, but good answers explain how and why these reasons faded and became uninteresting. Not broken, not lost, just *uninteresting*.\n\nGood answers don't involve him pining for home, don't draw attention to home and invoke complicated thinking about home. The astronaut is not trying to escape his fate, he is just doing his daily routine, performing maintenance, but he has accepted his hopeless fate, still performs his role out of a sense of duty, and that's it. Good answers don't invite much speculation into the outside world, and in fact the more boring the answer the better. Plausible shifts of corporate or political interest would be very suitable sources of reasons, as is having the job he was initially sent to do become meaningless, but they keep him there anyway, 'just in case'.\n\nThe astronaut isn't about to die. The station can keep him alive as long as he works on its maintenance, which he does. Good answers place the astronaut in a timeless, unchanging existence.\n\nAn occasional message from mission control, and regular automated supply drops are permitted. It is ok with alternative timelines, earths and histories, etc, but the technology in use should be clunky and old, but reasonably realistic. Higher levels of technology are acceptable elsewhere in the solar sytem, as long as its nowhere near the astronaut, and could even be used to show how everyone else has moved on, leaving the astronaut behind at his post. \n\nBonus points if the station is located somewhere with a beautiful view (like Saturns rings).

A change here resolved an issue with both xfce & gnome screensavers running simultaneously, but did nothing for the terminal issue.\n* Checked Application Autostart in `xfce4-session-settings`, but there's no default terminal entry. When I add one, two terminal windows pop up on startup.\n\nAccording to several guides I've found, editing the `xinitrc` file is key to the startup. However, I found no explicit terminal execution calls in that file.\n\nWhat is needed to modify the default terminal startup settings?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nAfter further investigation, it turns out it was a setting in GNOME that set the process off. I switch between GNOME, KDE and xfce for desktop environments, and the terminal popup was based on the GNOME startup settings. When that was modified, the terminal now shows up full-sized with no problems. [Response]",

I would have thought that even if Wireshark had no filter available for GVSP data, it would at least offer me the UDP data. But I don't see any data at all, despite being absolutely it is transmitted. Why not?\n\nIn my situation, I have a PLC triggering a camera regularly, which duly sends its images via GVSP to a host on an isolated network. Also, the PLC sends a UDP packet per trigger event down another isolated network to the same host. On that host, I run Wireshark, I capture on both channels simultaneously, and I see (1) visual evidence of the camera images arriving, (2) Wireshark evidence of the regular UDP packets, and (3) GVCP data from the camera.
